# arduino-iot-google-sheet-script
This repo contains a script (Code.gs) to integrate Arduino IoT Cloud with Google Sheets using web-hooks.
The script is part of a project in which data read from different sensors are sent to a google spreadsheet in order to
update tables and charts in real time.
Note: You have to make sure you add the url of spreadsheet (code between /d till /edit) in the google script code.
